<p>
In osTicket, Departments serve as the primary channels for ticket routing and agent assignment. Because tickets flow through specific departments (like IT, HR, or Customer Service), each department can be configured with its own unique settings to support its workflow. Because tickets are routed through Departments in osTicket, configuring each department with its own settings ensures the help desk can adapt to different support areas. This allows each team to operate independently while maintaining consistency and efficiency across the help desk system.

</p>
<p>
Teams in osTicket allow administrators to group agents from multiple departments into a single unit that can handle specific tickets, topics, or user groupsâ€”regardless of their individual department assignments. Suppose you have Agents in both the Billing and Technical Support departments who specialize in a product called X-Pro. You can create a Team called "X-Pro Specialists" and assign tickets from the "X-Pro Help Topic" to this Team. Even though the agents belong to different departments, they will receive and manage those tickets collaboratively.
